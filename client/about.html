                        For decades, the KJCA has served as the heartbeat of junior chess in the county. We aren't just a tournament organizer; we are a community-led association responsible for the development of junior chess from the first tentative moves in a primary school club to international-level competition.

                        We operate in close affiliation with the Kent County Chess Association (KCCA) and the English Chess Federation (ECF), ensuring that every child in Kent has a clear pathway to improve their game and represent their county at a national level.
