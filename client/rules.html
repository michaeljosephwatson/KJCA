                                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">1. Touch-Move Rule</h3>
                                <p>If a player intentionally touches a piece on the board when it is their turn to move, they must move that piece if it has a legal move. If they touch an opponent's piece, they must capture it if legal. Once a piece is placed on a square and the hand has released it, the move cannot be changed.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">2. Illegal Moves</h3>
                                <p>An illegal move occurs when a piece is moved in a way that violates the basic rules of chess. In most KJCA rapidplay events, the first illegal move results in a time penalty (usually adding two minutes to the opponent's clock). A second illegal move by the same player results in the loss of the game.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">3. The Two-Minute Rule</h3>
                                <p>If a player has less than two minutes remaining on their clock and believes their opponent is not making an effort to win by normal means (or cannot win by normal means), they may stop the clocks and summon the arbiter to claim a draw. This rule applies only in games played without increments.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">4. The 50-Move Rule</h3>
                                <p>A player may claim a draw if the last 50 consecutive moves by each side have been made without a capture and without a pawn move. This ensures games reach a fair conclusion when no progress is being made.</p>

                                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-2">5. Threefold Repetition</h3>
                                <p>The game is a draw if the same position occurs three times with the same player to move. The player must claim the draw before making the move that creates the third repetition or immediately after the opponent has made it.</p>
