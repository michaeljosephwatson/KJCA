# KJCA

![KJCA Readme Image](kjca_README.png)

This is the codebase for the new KJCA website. KJCA stands for the Kent Junior Chess Association. It is an organisation that is close to my heart having grown up playing chess through it. 

Going to their coaching days and playing in their tournaments gave me the fundamental chess experience that I needed to go on and play for the England Junior Team. Furthermore, this club grew my passion for chess ensuring that I continued to play beyond my junior years.

I have been asked to build the new website for them, hence the codebase. It is a simple JS/HTML/CSS stack with supabase to get a working production ready site as quickly as possible. Additionally, it is hosted with vercel and can be currently found at https://kjca.vercel.app

Feel free to offer any feedback or recommendations. Thank you!
